# World Marathons Interactive Dashboard


### In this project, 
- Create an interactive dashboard in the Jupyter notebook 
- I chose World Marathons Majors Dataset from Kaggle.
- I create a dynamic app inside of a notebook with 7 Dash components.
- I used these components:
1. Input Box allow for the user to input your name.
2. Output text for showing what the user wrote.
3. Dropdown List to choose the City of Marathon.
- Dropdown List interactive with two plots
- First: Line Plot. 
I used a Line Plot to see the winners in marathons over the years based on what users chose in a dropdown list of cities.
- Second: Scatter Plot.
4. I used Scatter Plot to show the Gender of the winner’s Marathon over the years based on what users chose in a dropdown list of cities.
5. Radio Button to allow to user choose one year of Marathon to see the winner and Country
- Radio Button interactive with one plot is (Bar Plot)
- I Used Bar Plot to show the year and winner’s name.
